level 20
	There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: 
	it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. 113

It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20).

If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think
	inetd is the network daemon, it acts like a dispatcher listening in designated ports (/etc/inetd.conf)

FROM STRINGS TO THE BIN: Usage: %s <portnumber>
This program will connect to the given port on localhost using TCP. If it receives the correct password from the other side, the next password is transmitted back.
